# Keylogger

## Overview

This Python script captures keystrokes on the user's keyboard and logs them into a text file. It utilizes the `pynput` library to monitor keyboard events.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amitraj29/PRODIGY_CS_04.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd PRODIGY_CS_04
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install pynput
    ```

## Usage

1. Disable Windows Antivirus:
    Due to the nature of the functionality, the Windows antivirus might detect the script as malicious. Disable the antivirus temporarily to run the script successfully.

2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python keylogger.py
    ```

3. The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes silently.

4. To stop the keylogger, press `Ctrl + C`.
